###Did you always want to go into food?
I've spent time working under professional chefs and it was great but it doesn't give me the joy that I get from running something smaller, a bit more creative. When I was younger I always dreamt about having a tea shop. <span data-clip="argentina" class='hover_clip'>I used to carry around a notebook and write down anything that I though worked well. <img src="{{site.url}}/images/speaker.png"></span>  The year that I spent living in Scandinavia was definitely a tipping point. It was amazing to see the way that they avoid refined ingredients and incorporate spices.<span class='hover_clip' data-clip="copenhagen"> They truly embrace grains there. <img src="{{site.url}}/images/speaker.png"></span>

###Why did you choose to focus on porridge?
I love all kinds of food but when you begin [a business] it's important to be known for something. <span data-clip="bacon" class='hover_clip'>I chose porridge as a place to start due to the time I spent in Copenhagen. <img src="{{site.url}}/images/speaker.png"></span> In Denmark they have this word, 'Hygge'. There is no literal translation into English but in essence it means comfort - sharing - togetherness - warmth; <span data-clip="badly" class='hover_clip'>and porridge really sums it up. <img src="{{site.url}}/images/speaker.png"></span>

###Isn't it only for breakfast?
No! The ways you can eat it are endless. During exams I once had it three times a day for a week. Hot chocolate porridge with cacao is an amazing afternoon snack. But you can also use grains in savory ways so that it becomes almost like a salad. <span data-clip="flexible" class="hover_clip">It's very flexible. <img src="{{site.url}}/images/speaker.png"></span>

###What was the best moment you've had so far?
The first customer who decided to buy a pot. That felt amazing. And then... it's wonderful every time someone decides to come back.

###On starting up:
<span data-clip="messingup" class="hover_clip">"Just do it! <img src="{{site.url}}/images/speaker.png"></span> Even if it's only a supper club with friends to start with. Pop ups are a really low risk way to try concepts out. I used to make endless lists. When the space at Old st station came up I had no idea about price points or what would really work <span data-clip="herewego" class="hover_clip">but it was such a great opportunity so I went for it. <img src="{{site.url}}/images/speaker.png"></span>

###Is there anything you wished you had?
Easy - a permanent space. Pop up events typically aren't there for very long and the people going by are in a hurry. It can be difficult to get their attention and immediately convey what you are about. After the first few days at Old Street station we started playing music in the mornings and that really worked!

>People said to us; "I love this song, I want to be part of what you are doing."

###What do you know that you would like other people to consider?
Make a conscious decision about which businesses you choose to support. <span data-clip="voting" class="hover_clip">Every penny that you spend is a form of voting. <img src="{{site.url}}/images/speaker.png"></span> You have the power to keep ideas alive.
